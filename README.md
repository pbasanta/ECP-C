# ECP-C An real-time framework for Arduino based on real-time Java


Next generation applications will demand more cost-effective programming abstractions to reduce increasing maintenance and development costs. In this context, the article explores the integration of an efficient programming language and high-level real-time programming abstractions. The resulting abstraction is called Embedded Cyber Physical C (ECP-C) and it is useful for designing real-time applications directly on C. The abstraction has its roots on the real-time Java: one of the most modern programming languages, which benefited from mature programming patterns previously developed for other languages. It also targets embedded processors running on limited hardware. ECP-C takes the programming abstractions described in real-time Java and reflects them into a C application system, providing extensions for multi-threading, resource sharing, memory management, external event, signaling, and memory access. It also reports on the performance results obtained in a set of infrastructures used to check ECP-C, providing clues on the overhead introduced by these mechanisms on limited infrastructures.
